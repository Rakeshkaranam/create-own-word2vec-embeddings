# Create your own word2vec on any corpus

## This repo contains the code for creating own word2vec embeddings using neural networks (No Gensim)

### Steps:

### 1. Prepare text corpus

### 2. Tokenize unique words with unique id

### 3. Generate skipgrams using Keras Inbuilt function 

### 4. Create Model Architecture with Input layers as Embedding layers and output as a binary classifier

### 5. Train and Predict
